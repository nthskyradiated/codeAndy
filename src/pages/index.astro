				<h1> Welcome ~/</h1>
				<p>You have reached my (redesigned) personal website where I journal stuff I am mostly interested about (and I have lots of stuff I am interested about! ðŸ¤ª). We will explore thoughts, break down concepts, deconstruct ideas, and put them back together into bite-sized nuggets of wisdom! (I hope!)</p>
				<p>Unlilke before, I will try to post stuff as frequent as I possibly could just to keep the site alive. But enough about that! I hope you stick around and enjoy your stay!</p>
